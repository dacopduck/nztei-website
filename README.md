Kia ora, Xin chao
This is my first web development project when I first started my IT journey within 2 months. 
I will admit that my website is not the best, or the most polished one out there.
I will keep my website as it is, and use it as a milestone for me to compare with all of my future projects and endevours.
Future employers feel free to judge and give me criticism, I will take them holistically and learn from it. ;)
